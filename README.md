## OKBOT 1.0

This is a legacy branch of old OKBOT, written in JS by Simir back in the day.
At that time, there was no version control used, that's why it's not in sync with other branches.

//Simir's personal note: DON'T JUDGE ME ON THIS. I was learning programming back then and the only thing I knew were control flow statements.


//What I learnt one day I replaced the other, so this is a short-term solution on a short-term solution.


//I can write exponentially better code today, this should serve as a reminder of how bad I was back when I was learning.
